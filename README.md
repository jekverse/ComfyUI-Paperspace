# ComfyUI with Flux Dev FP16 Setup

This repository is designed for setting up ComfyUI with the Flux Dev FP16 model, specifically optimized for users running on Paperspace Gradient.

## Prerequisites

- **Paperspace Gradient** account is required.
- This setup has been tested on **A4000 GPUs**. Using GPUs below this specification is not recommended.

## Key Features

- No **persistent storage charges**! Since this repository runs outside of the Notebooks and Storage directories, you wonâ€™t incur extra storage fees typically charged by Paperspace. However, this means that the repository is not stored after use.
- The repository utilizes a **Python virtual environment**, ensuring no dependency conflicts with other projects or systems.

## How to Use

1. Open your Paperspace terminal.
2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
    ```
3. Wait until the output shows the **local URL**.
4. Access ComfyUI using the following URL:  
   [https://comfyuiflux.jekverse.site/](https://comfyuiflux.jekverse.site/)
